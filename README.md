# TicTacToe
This Tic Tac Toe game is a small project I built to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It’s a fun two-player game where each player takes turns marking “O” and “X” on a 3x3 grid. The game automatically checks for a winner after every move and shows a message if someone wins or if it’s a draw. It also has buttons to reset or start a new game. Through this project, I learned how to handle user interactions, update the DOM, and build simple game logic using JavaScript.
